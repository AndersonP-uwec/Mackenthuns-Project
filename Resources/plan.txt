Plan:

1. Your site must use at least two different font faces. 
Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and body in a serif font.


2. Your site must include at least four web pages implementing some sort of form 
(or informal collection of input elements). 
The form might submit data to a server using 
POST requests and retrieve data using GET requests. 
/// implements products thing with this 

3. Your site must include links to external sites. 
Clicking on external links must open a new tab or window rather than replace your page.
// we can do this easily

4. Your site must include at least one animation, powered either by CSS or JavaScript.
// cart animation (simple, not too late)

5. Your site should be able to use either MySQL or SQLite databases for storing and retrieving data. 
You could also use JSON format to implement this feature. 
/// implement products thing w this 

6. BONUS POINTS: If you implement different functionality based on login credentials 
(such as administrators, users) you will be receiving 5 extra points. 
(Total is 40 points)
/// if we have time (we dont)

7. You should address the comments and feedback from Project 1 in this Project 2.
// products listings whatever
