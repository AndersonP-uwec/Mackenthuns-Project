                <p class="deptopparagraph"> Mackenthun’s began as a meat market in the early 1900s, and has built upon its exceptional 
                    reputation ever since. Fresh, high quality products are not just a standard, but a norm. 
                    Mackenthun's Meat and Seafood Department hand selects products from local vendors to provide 
                    you with the highest quality choices available at competitive prices and can be cut to any 
                    specifications or request. </p><br>

            <h2> Seafood </h2>
                <img class = "verlasso" src = "Images/Verlasso Logo.png" alt = "seafood">
                <p class="deptopparagraph"> Verlasso works closely with their local communities to reduce environmental impact with
                    proven innovative sustainable farming techniques.</p>

                <p class="deptopparagraph"> The fish are respectfully handled throughout their life, as their low pen density is 
                    half of industry norms to ensure the fish have plenty of room to swim and grow. They 
                    utilize a two-net system in-water with a canopy net over the water to protect their 
                    fish from predators and to protect the natural environment.</p>

                <p class="deptopparagraph"> At harvest, fish are anesthetized and harvested without brutality to ensure quality fish. 
                    The fish are harvested and shipped on the same day to ensure this freshness. Verlasso does 
                    not use any growth hormones.</p>
